# Pump.Fun Trading Bot

## Description
The website Pump.Fun is a cryptocurrency trading platform that focuses specifically on coins often considered to have little intrinsic value. Our group has developed a CLI-based bot that operates on the Pump.Fun platform to enhance a user's effectiveness in trading. This bot provides rapid and strategic trading tools designed to exploit the volatile nature of the market.

## Key Features

- **Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors the generation of new coins on Pump.Fun. Given the high frequency at which new coins appear, the bot is designed to quickly assess and engage with potential trading opportunities.

- **Value Assessment**: To evaluate a newly generated coin, the bot analyzes several indicators:
  - **Social Media Presence**: Checks whether the coin has an active presence on Twitter or Telegram.
  - **Official Website Quality**: Assesses the presence and quality of an official website, which can lend credibility to a coin.
  - **Market Uniqueness**: The bot examines whether the coin is a duplicate of existing tokens.

- **Early Buying Strategy**: A crucial factor of successful trading is purchasing a coin at a low market cap. This strategy aims to capitalize on initial low prices before any potential surge in value.

- **Automated Trading Decisions**: Based on the criteria mentioned above, the bot will automatically execute buy and sell decisions to optimize trading outcomes.
